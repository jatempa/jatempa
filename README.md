### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have been a software developer since 2010 and I have worked with different technologies. Currently I have been focused on the Frontend area using ReactJS and VueJS for web, as well as Flutter for mobile.

I like to continue learning about different topics such as Distributed Systems and Machine Learning, as well as continue improving in algorithms and architecture to create more scalable and solid products.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **ReactJS** using **NextJS** framework.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Remix JS** framework.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on development of robust applications with social reach that allow people to access different services that facilitate their activities.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about topics related to programming and count on me if I can help you.
